blackjaaack!!
project proposal

string parsing?
- modified our input and made sure it was valid for the operations we were tryna do
had to wrap a lot of the checking for values inside if statements

exclamation point?? >>!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
we got 2 distinct error from the same code block? 
exception handling 
dealing with runtime errors in our program gracefully

runtime errors
- value error
- division by 0
- type error

try:
  code block
except <exception>:
  <if some runtime error happens, execute this block>
finally:
  <regardless if try or except succeds, run this block>

we say a program has a runtime error has a runtime error
---
thingy not finished vv

try:
  x = int(input"enter num1: ")
  y = int(input"enter num2: ")

----

except Exception as e:
  #this captures all possible errors that are not value errors or 0 errors
  print(e)

"""
strings and parsing strings 

strings are ordered lissts of characters

same ideas from lists also work for strings
can use len for length

sqaure bracket indicators
only difference is way we add and remove 

python knowledge bomb
    reasson why we can use thing, lists and strings bot inherit from the name parent called an iterable << python trivia
    
inputs do not like typos
    our desing pattern so far only works with very strict int parsing
    
python has a lot of built in functions that let us parse strings better
ex.
    .strip
        removes bleeding and trailing white space
        mystr = mystr.strip()
    .lower
        forces everything to be lowercase
    .upper
        forces everything to be uppercase
    
    
isnumeric()
    returns True if the stirngs its called on isa  number
    
/n separatres new text 
    escape sequence
    new line
    
parse my peom string and separate each line into tis own element of a list calles lines

.split(lines) << retuyrbns a lkuist oidf strinfgs where each elenmet iss split by a neline

final.io 
    file inoput / output
    done by parsing text from sude iof a .txt
        textfile called accounts, had it have all anmes

""" 
We just did 2D lists which are just lists of lists. The only real way we know to aggregate data under one variable name is through lists.

Today we are going to learn dictionaries, which is another kind of data structures

data structures = its own subfield of CS dedicated to the storage of information and efficient retrival/sorting of that data

Dictionaries == Hashmaps/Hash tables in other programming languages

Information in dictionaries are stored using something called a hash function <- a really complicated mathematics function
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function <- Source if you want to learn how this works theoretically


Lists <- ORDERED collections of data under one variable name

What uniquely determines a value inside of a list? <- the index uniquely determines a value/position

list = [1,0,1,1,1] <- the difference between the ones is which index its at.

What happens if you remove something in the middle of a list? Everything AFTER that value shifts over to i-1, which is BAD in some cases. 

Think about our implementation for bank:

names = []
balances = []

We supposed that the schema (defining structure of the data) of names and balances is that each name and balance shares THE SAME index

JOHN = INDEX 0 = names[0] and balances[0] 

This is not the ideal way to do this for this reason: 
    - Remove people from the bank.
    - If WE ONLY removed from names
    
    
Joseph, Mark
1000, 0, -250

If we get any sort of schema drift (if the lists become misaligned), then all of a sudden our records are not correct anymore. This is the motivation
for why we care about dictionaries

Lists had indices and values,

Dictionaries have key-value pairs

A dictionary is an UNORDERED list where the elements are (key,value) pairs

"""

mydict = {}
        #curly braces to define a dictionary

#we can populate a dictionary at variable instantiation by using :,s

mydict2 = {"John":1000, "Joseph":0, "Mark":-250}
#So now each name and balance is instead a key,value pair inside of a dictionary. 
#How do we retrieve from a dictionary? How did you do it for a list? You would use the square bracket operator

print(mydict2["John"]) #what do we expect to print out? 1000

""" 
Getting values from a dictionary uses this syntax

<name of the dictionary>[<key>] <- this returns the value at the key
"""

print(mydict2["Mark"]) #-250

""" 
Rather than indices uniquely determining values, KEYS uniquely determine values. 

Let's talk about keys:
    - What is allowed to be a key? IMMUTABLE OBJECTS
        - Mutable: Lists
        - Immutable: strings, numerics
        - Immutable objects are the only things allowed to be keys <- its because of the hash function really 
        
        | key 2 | key 1 | key 3
          4 bytes 2 bytes  1 byte
    - Can a key have more than one value? NO
        - Graphical test we use in algebra 2 to determine if a graph is a function? 
            - VLT = Every X value has EXACTLY one Y value
            - Dictionaries work on a hash FUNCTION

Let's talk about Values:
    - What is allowed to be a value? LITERALLY ANYTHING can be a value? 
        - does that include lists? YES
        - does that include strings? YES
        - does that include ints? YES
        - does that include another dictionary? YES

The question is, how we get get "a" from this dictionary?

How did we get individual values from a 2D list? How many sets of square brackets did we use? two sets?

The same syntax works for nested lists inside dictionaries and nested dictionaries inside dictionaries

Keep this example in your brain, highly important for the lab? How about adding things to a dictionary

""" 
How about removing something from a dictionary? There are two different ways: one of which is very unsafe, the other way implicitly handles
the exception that you could get. 

1) del keyword <- this just zaps the key:value pair from memory 

"""
del mydict2["John"]
print(mydict2)

""" 
The second way is .pop(), which is a much safer way, for a list this takes in ONE parameters.

but for a dictionary, it takes in two parameters.

We've answered:
    1)How do we retrieve information

    1)How do looping statements behave for dictionaries
    
The developers of python have two natural choices for what happens in a for-each loop

we DONT want to do that
